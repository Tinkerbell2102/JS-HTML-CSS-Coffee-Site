            <h1>History of coffee</h1>
            <p>
                The origin of coffee date back to 600 A.D. 
                There are several legends about the origin of coffee, one of wich states that in Eastern Africa, 
                a sheperd called Kaldi observed that his goats were overactive when they ate cherry-red berries from 
                a shrub. He tried to eat some of the berries, and found himself invigorated too.
                Soon, news spread about the stimulating affects of these berries, and monks started sing the berries 
                to stay awake during their long hours of prayer.
            </p>
            <p>    
                From <span class="word">Eastern Africa</span>, coffee was transported to 
                <span class="word">Arabia</span> and then to <span class="word">Turkey</span>, 
                where they roasted the beans and boiled them and gave rise to a crude of coffee that we use today. 
                Soon, coffee spread to <span class="word">Europe</span>, <span class="word">America</span> and other continents, and now it is one of the most popular 
                beverages enjoyed by multitudes of people all over the world.
